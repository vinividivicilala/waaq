- NodeJs _[18.x] (Runtime Environment for JavaScripts)_

## \# Motivation or Description

<p>
  This web application is a single page application (SPA) coded in `Reactjs` & `TypeScript`. Its primary focus is to deliver a usual shop page for various products. Where user can see all the products and filter, sort, or search on their own. Also can add to their cart.

I have used `Zustand` for making global state handlers and `ReactQuery` for query or calling and caching the api returned data. So, the api-server can be less called and reduced api calls.

Finally, I have get-started with @netlify/functions for the first time with it.
It helped me to have mock data as JSON-API. Though It can be handled as a backend service. But for this tiny project it wasn't necessary.
